# Getting Started

**Obtention of an API Key**

   * Contact the LAOS Foundation / Freeverse.io to request your private API key.
   * Each key is associated with a web3 address where you can view LAOS tokens, POLs, and ETHs.
   * Your account will be pre-filled with testnet LAOS tokens. Contact the LAOS Foundation for replenishment if needed.

**API Key Usage**

Add your API key to the headers of all mutations:

    ```json
    {
      "x-api-key": "your-api-key-here-1234"
    }
    ```
