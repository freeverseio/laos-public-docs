LAOS's main documentation can be found here:

* [**LAOS Whitepaper**](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-whitepaper/blob/main/laos.pdf), for an in-depth, fully detailed description.
* [**LAOS Litepaper**](https://spaces.gorengine.com/laos/LAOS_litepaper.pdf), for a high-level, use case oriented description.
* [**LAOS Tokenpaper**](https://laos.gitbook.io/laos-whitepaper/), for a description of the LAOS utility token, and its associated tokenomics.

The following videos serve as an introduction to Bridgeless Minting and Evolution:

* LAOS Bridgeless Minting & Evolution, [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU63SU6s0sY).
* LAOS Bridgeless Minting & Evolution, [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDoEp7mFlTg).

Hands-on material:

* The following [post](https://medium.com/laosnetwork/bridgeless-minting-on-ethereum-polygon-and-other-chains-ae69a4b6a91e) contains a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIe3nsjQIYA) demoing bridgeless minting of a **Universal** in Ethereum.
* A simple on-boarding site to help you [create your first Universals](https://apps.klaos.io/) with a few clicks.

LAOS is fully open source and decentralized. The main code repositories are:

* [**The LAOS Parachain**](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos#the-laos-parachain-monorepo). To streamline the development process and encourage diverse contributions, all core components of the Parachain were integrated in this single monorepo.
* [**The Universal ERC721 Solidity Templates**](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-erc721). This template contains the minimal extensions of the ERC721 OpenZeppelin implementation that enables bridgeless minting and evolution in any EVM chain.
* [**The Examples Repository**](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-examples)**.** Short scripts showing how to interact with LAOS using standard web3 libraries.
* The [**LAOS Smart-Contracts Repository**](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-smart-contracts) contains examples of smart contracts that extend the basic logic provided by the protocol-level precompiles. For example, the [**BatchMinter**](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-smart-contracts/tree/main/batch-minter) contract allows minting or evolving a large number of assets in a single transaction, while the [**PublicMinter**](https://github.com/freeverseio/laos-smart-contracts/tree/main/public-minter) contract temporarily grants minting access to everyone.
