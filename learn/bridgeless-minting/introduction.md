# Introduction

Bridgeless Minting and Evolution represents a notable example of a process where a consensus system is used to expand the capabilities of another consensus system, via usage of Universal Location.

We coined the term _**Universal**_ to refer to an NFT created via Bridgeless Minting.

The videos below offer an in-depth explanation of this mechanism:

Additionally, the [following website](https://testnet.apps.laosnetwork.io/) provides a simple frontend to start experimenting with bridgeless minting on blockchains such as Ethereum or Polygon. Internally, this sample application employs the queries outlined in the rest of this section.



### Steps

#### Setup

The initial setup phase of using bridgeless minting involves **one-time** transactions: deploying an ERC721 collection on your preferred blockchain (e.g., Ethereum or Polygon) and establishing a sibling collection in LAOS.

#### Mint & Evolve

Subsequent minting and evolution occur directly on LAOS, thereby bypassing congestion and gas fees on the selected blockchain.

#### Trade, Lend, DeFi

Asset owners can carry on with all activities in a way that's fully compliant with ERC721 on their blockchain of choice. This includes trading on preferred marketplaces and utilizing NFTs in lending contracts, among other actions.
