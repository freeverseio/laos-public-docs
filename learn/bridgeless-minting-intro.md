# Bridgeless Minting & Evolution

Bridgeless Minting and Bridgeless Evolution represents a notable example of a process where a consensus system is used to expand the capabilities of another consensus system, via usage of Universal Location.

<figure><img src="/img/setupCollection_evolve.png" alt=""></img><figcaption>In Bridgeless Minting, a one-time transaction on the blockchain to be scaled (e.g. Ethereum, left side) deploys an ERC721
contract connected to a sibling collection on LAOS (right side). From that moment on, all minting and evolution takes place on the LAOS consensus system, while recipients of those assets can trade them as native ERC721 on Ethereum, using their favourite Ethereum DApps and wallets. </figcaption></figure>


#### Setup

The initial setup phase of using bridgeless minting involves **one-time** transactions: deploying an ERC721 collection on your preferred blockchain (e.g., Ethereum or Polygon) and establishing a sibling collection in LAOS.

#### Mint & Evolve

Subsequent minting and evolution occur directly on LAOS, thereby bypassing congestion and gas fees on the selected blockchain.

#### Trade, Lend, DeFi

Asset owners can carry on with all activities in a way that's fully compliant with ERC721 on their blockchain of choice. This includes trading on preferred marketplaces and utilizing NFTs in lending contracts, among other actions.
