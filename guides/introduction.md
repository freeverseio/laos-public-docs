# Introduction

Welcome to the LAOS guides. This section is divided into two parts:

1. **[Using the EVM interface](./evm/collection-setup)**: Guides for direct blockchain interactions. This path is fully permissionless and decentralized, offering complete control and transparency over network interactions.

2. **[Assisted by the API](./api/introduction)**: Step-by-step instructions for interacting with the LAOS network via the API maintained by the LAOS Foundation. This approach simplifies integration and supports development similar to traditional Web2 systems.

Choose the approach that best suits your goals to start building with LAOS.
