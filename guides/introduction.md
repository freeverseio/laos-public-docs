# Introduction

Welcome to the LAOS guides. This section is divided into two parts:

1. **[Using the EVM interface](./evm/collection-setup)**: Guides for direct blockchain interactions. This path is fully permissionless and decentralized, offering complete control and transparency over network interactions.

2. **Assisted by the API**. Step-by-step instructions for interacting with the LAOS network via [the API](../api/introduction) maintained by the LAOS Foundation. This approach simplifies integration and supports development similar to traditional Web2 systems.

The guide for the second option is under construction. Stay tuned!
