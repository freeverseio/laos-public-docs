# Introduction

Welcome to the LAOS guides. This section is divided into two parts:

1. **Without API**: Guides for direct blockchain interactions. This method is more decentralized, providing full control and transparency over interactions with the network.

2. **With API**: Step-by-step instructions for interacting with the LAOS network via its API. This approach is easier to integrate and allows for development similar to traditional Web2 systems.

Choose the approach that aligns with your goals and start building with LAOS.
